# [WIP] Go Design Patterns

My own collection of Software Design Patterns written in Go (GoLang.  
For learning purposes: Some design patterns may not make sense when writing idiomatic Go.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

| Pattern          | Description | Gists |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Abstract Factory | Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. | Todo |
| Builder          | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. |     Todo |
| Factory Method   | Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.        |                        Todo                                                  |
| Prototype        | Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance and create new objects by copying this prototype. | Todo |
| Singleton        | Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. | [Link](https://gist.github.com/maxclav/2200c92d3cf3ed362b90d1fae0bdd03f) |
